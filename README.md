# MarketSentimentModel
 This is a project comprised of two aspects: 1. a machine learning model that outputs a sentiment value on a certain stock and 2. a web scraper that does your research for you to output a single sentiment value using the trained ML model 

# Current Status
The base model using a pre-trained BERT model that was trained using the FinancialPhraseBank has been completed. 
The next steps comprise of the following:
1. Try to achieve better results by adjusting the hyperparameters of the model as well as trying different optimizers.
2. Try using different models other than BERT to observe the strength of BERT vs. others.
3. Develop a web-scraper that utilizes the trained model to research the web for symbols and output a single sentiment value.
