# MarketSentimentModel
 This is a project comprised of two aspects:
 1. A trained BERT machine learning model that takes in tokenized news headlines as input and outputs a single sentiment value (negative, neutral, or positive).
 2. An application that utilizes the SerpAPI to pull results from Google News based on a stock symbol that is inputted and then subsequently outputs a sentiment value.
